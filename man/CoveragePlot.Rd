\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object}

\item{region}{A set of genomic coordinates to show. Can be a GRanges object, a string, or a vector of strings describing the genomic
coordinates to plot.}

\item{annotation}{An Ensembl based annotation package}

\item{assay}{Name of the  assay to plot}

\item{fragment.path}{Path to an index fragment file. If NULL, will look for a path stored for the
requested assay using the \code{\link{SetFragments}} function}

\item{group.by}{Name of one or more metadata columns to group (color) the cells by. Default is the current cell identities}

\item{window}{Smoothing window size}

\item{downsample}{Fraction of positions to retain in the plot. Default is 0.1 (retain 10 percent, ie every 10th position)}

\item{height.tracks}{Height of the accessibility tracks relative to the height of the gene annotation track.
Default is 2 (twice as high as annotation track).}

\item{extend.upstream}{Number of bases to extend the region upstream (Default 0)}

\item{extend.downstream}{Number of bases to extend the region downstream (Default 0)}

\item{ymax}{Maximum value for Y axis. If NULL (default) set to the highest value among all the tracks.}

\item{scale.factor}{Scaling factor for track height. If NULL (default), use the median group scaling factor
determined by total number of fragments sequences in each group.}

\item{cells}{Which cells to plot. Default all cells}

\item{idents}{Which identities to include in the plot. Default is all identities.}

\item{sep}{Separators to use for strings encoding genomic coordinates. First element is used to separate the
chromosome from the coordinates, second element is used to separate the start from end coordinate.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[cowplot]{plot_grid}}}
